        <h2>Phases of computer program development:</h2>
        <b>
        <li>Phase 1: Understand the problem</li>
        <li>Phase 2: Design an algorithm to solve the problem</li>
        <li>Phase 3: Write the program code in appropriate language based on the algorithm</li>
        <li>Phase 4: Enter the program and save</li>
        <li>Phase 5: Execute the program</li>
        <li>Phase 6: Test the program, find errors and debug, then retest</li>
        <li>Phase 7: Document and evaluate the program</li>

        <h2>Programming structures:</h2>
        <b>
        <li>Sequential structure: Top-down execution</li>
        <li>Decision structures: if/then/else</li>
        <li>Iterative (looping):
            <ul> 
                <li>while loop: continue looping as long as something is true</li>
                <li>repeat/until loop: continue looping until something is true</li>
                <li>for loop: loop a given number of times</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Recursive Structures:</li>
            <ul>
                <li>Repeat a set of instructions as a subtask of itself</li>
                <li>Repetition continues until:
                    <ul>
                        <li>degenerative case, which is a termination condition, is met

        <h2>Two classic programming/database problems:</h2>
        <b>
        <li>Sorting: Descending order/Ascending order</li>
            <ul>
                <li>Sorting numbers</li>
                <li>Sorting strings (in accordance with ASCII values)</li>
            </ul>
        <li>Searching: find specific data that meet a certain criteria</li>
            <ul>
                <li>In database:</li>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Filters: temporary search</li>
                        <li>Queries: search criteria are saved so they don't have to be recreated</li>
                    </ul>
            </ul>
        <li>Two popular search techniques:</li>
            <ul>
                <li>Sequential search: search from top to bottom or bottom to top, one item at a time</li>
                <li>Binary search:</li>
                    <ul>
                        <li>only works if data is sorted first</li>
                        <li>start in the middle, then go to half of that, etc.</li>

        <h2>Two classic program goals:</h2>
        <b>
