    <h2> Mission </h2>

        <p>The U.S. Department of the Interior manages and protects natural resources and cultural heritage. 
            It provides scientific information about the natural resources in the United States. It has 
            the responsibility and special commitment to honor American Indians, Alaska Natives, and 
            affiliated Island Communities.</p>

    <h2> Priorities </h2>

        <p>Work towards addressing four intersecting challenges including COVID-19, economic recovery, 
            racial equity, and climate change as mandated by President Biden. To meet the challenges, 
            the department is focusing on the following:</p>

                        waters to benefit future generations.</li>

        <p>The Department of the Interior was created from a bill that passed on March 3, 1849, and charged 
            with taking care of the Nation's internal affairs. The department has often been referred to as 
            the Department of Everything since it has had many government responsibilities. The original focus 
            of the department was internal development of the Nation and the welfare of its people. Many of 
            the original domestic concerns the department dealt with were gradually transferred to other 
            departments. For example, the Department of Interior was responsible for water pollution control 
            prior to the creation of the Environmental Protection Agency. Another agency that later became a 
            separate department was the Department of Agriculture. However, protection and management of 
            natural resources, Indigenous tribal concerns, and wildlife conservation have remained the 
            responsibility of the Department of the Interior.</p>

        <p>In 2001 Gale A. Norton was nominated and become the first woman to serve as Secretary of the 
            Interior.  The current secretary is Deb Haaland and she made history by being the first Native 
            American to serve as cabinet secretary. She is a member of the Pueblo of Laguna and 35th 
            generation New Mexican. In 2014, she became the first Native American woman to be elected to 
            lead a State Party by becoming the New Mexico Lieutenant Governor. She is also one of the first 
            Native American women to serve in Congress focusing on environmental justice, climate change, 
            missing and murdered indigenous women, and family policies. </p>

    <h2> Responsibilities </h2>

        <p>The Department of the Interior has a central role in how the United States manages public lands, 
            protects the environment, ensures environmental justice, and honors relationships with indigenous 
            communities. The U.S. Department of the Interior manages America's natural and cultural resources. 
            It is a Cabinet-level agency that employs about 70,000 people. This includes eleven technical 
            bureaus made up of scientists and resource management professionals. </p>
